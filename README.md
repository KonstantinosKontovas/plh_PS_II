### The following has been part of an excercise of the Hellenic Open University, in the field of Computer Science's subject Digital Systems II. One of the tasks we did included the following using assembly ARM (Cortex M3) :   

erot1.1_project_kontovas : it is an assembly ARM (Cortex M3) programm that prints the numbers 1,4,7,0A...46 in the memory addresses 0x2000020 - 0x20000037.

erot1.2_project_kontovas : it is an assembly ARM (Cortex M3) programm that prints the fibonacci numbers starting 0,1,1,2,3,5...DB03 memory addresses starting from 0x20000100

erot1.3_project_kontovas : it is an assembly ARM (Cortex M3) programm that calculates the average sum of n non-zero given numbers and stores the result at address 0x20000000





The ".s" extension contains the assembly code. The rest of the extensions have been automatically generated.
